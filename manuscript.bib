@inproceedings{Zhi2001,
abstract = {The computational cost of encryption is a barrier to wider application of a variety of data security protocols. Virtually all research on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) provides evidence to suggest that ECC can provide a family of encryption algorithms that require fewer computational resources for implementation than do current widely used methods. This efficiency is obtained since ECC allows much shorter key lengths for equivalent levels of security. This paper suggests how improvements in execution of ECC algorithms can be obtained by changing the representation of the elements of the finite field of the ECC algorithm. Specifically, this research compares the time complexity of ECC computation over a variety of finite fields with elements expressed in the polynomial basis (PB) and normal basis (NB). Results presented here suggest that NB representations reduce the average aggregate time to perform basic ECC operations by a factor of 40 compared to the time required for operations in PB representation. A comparison of execution times for ECC and discrete log implementations of the ElGamal protocol is also presented},

                  limitless block-length. This is a class of codes

                  In this talk I will introduce several classes of
                  probabilistic Fountain codes, including LT-and
                  Raptor codes, show tools for their design and
                  analysis, and discuss how they are used today to
                  solve various data transmission problems on
                  heterogenous unreliable networks. I will also talk
                  about the theory of these codes when transmission
                  takes place over non-erasure channels, and
                  low-complexity algorithms are used for their
                  decoding.},

@article{Chen2014,
abstract = {It is already true that Big Data has drawn huge attention from researchers in information sciences, policy and decision makers in governments and enterprises. As the speed of information growth exceeds Moore's Law at the beginning of this new century, excessive data is making great troubles to human beings. However, there are so much potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of data. A new scientific paradigm is born as data-intensive scientific discovery (DISD), also known as Big Data problems. A large number of fields and sectors, ranging from economic and business activities to public administration, from national security to scientific researches in many areas, involve with Big Data problems. On the one hand, Big Data is extremely valuable to produce productivity in businesses and evolutionary breakthroughs in scientific disciplines, which give us a lot of opportunities to make great progresses in many fields. There is no doubt that the future competitions in business productivity and technologies will surely converge into the Big Data explorations. On the other hand, Big Data also arises with many challenges, such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a close-up view about Big Data, including Big Data applications, Big Data opportunities and challenges, as well as the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies we currently adopt to deal with the Big Data problems. We also discuss several underlying methodologies to handle the data deluge, for example, granular computing, cloud computing, bio-inspired computing, and quantum computing. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Wales1997,
abstract = {We describe a global optimization technique using `basin-hopping' in which the potential energy surface is transformed into a collection of interpenetrating staircases. This method has been designed to exploit the features which recent work suggests must be present in an energy landscape for efficient relaxation to the global minimum. The transformation associates any point in configuration space with the local minimum obtained by a geometry optimization started from that point, effectively removing transition state regions from the problem. However, unlike other methods based upon hypersurface deformation, this transformation does not change the global minimum. The lowest known structures are located for all Lennard-Jones clusters up to 110 atoms, including a number that have never been found before in unbiased searches.},
